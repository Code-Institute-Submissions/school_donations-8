# WHAT I WILL DO: A REMINDER

1.  You will organise the presentation layer layout to display the data in a visually effective manner.
2.  You will add at least one additional data dimension and associated visualization to the data already presented on the dashboard.
3.  You will include additional functionality that provides a Dashboard tutorial, which targets each Dashboard element with an explanation of its purpose (see guidelines below this list).
4.  You will embed the dashboard into a site â€“ either one you have already created or a new simple site instance.
5.  You will make a great and wonderful thing of beauty.
